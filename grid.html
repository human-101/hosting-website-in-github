            <h2>tiger</h2>
            <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is
                most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator,
                it primarily preys on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary
                but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for
                prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, then become
                independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.</p>

            <h2>lion</h2>
            <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a
                muscular, broad-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail.
                It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a
                social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related
                females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The
                lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have
                been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not actively seek out and prey on humans.</p>

            <h2>rhinoceros</h2>
            <p>A rhinoceros (/raɪˈnɒsərəs/; from Ancient Greek ῥῑνόκερως (rhīnókerōs) 'nose-horned'; from ῥῑνός (rhīnós)
                'nose', and κέρας (kéras) 'horn'), commonly abbreviated to rhino, is a member of any of the five extant
                species (or numerous extinct species) of odd-toed ungulates in the family Rhinocerotidae. (It can also
                refer to a member of any of the extinct species of the superfamily Rhinocerotoidea.) Two of the extant
                species are native to Africa, and three to South and Southeast Asia.</p>

            <h2>elephant</h2>
            <p>Elephants are the largest existing land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: the
                African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. They are an informal
                grouping within the subfamily Elephantinae of the order Proboscidea; extinct members include the
                mastodons. Elephantinae also contains several extinct groups, including the mammoths and straight-tusked
                elephants. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller
                ears, and convex or level backs. The distinctive features of all elephants include a long proboscis
                called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, massive legs, and tough but sensitive skin. The trunk is used
                for breathing, bringing food and water to the mouth, and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from
                the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear
                flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. The pillar-like
                legs carry their great weight.</p>
